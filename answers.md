1. If you only had 200 labeled replies, how would you improve the model without collecting thousands more?
I’d use data augmentation techniques like paraphrasing, back translation, or synonym replacement to expand the dataset. Additionally, I’d leverage transfer learning with a pre-trained transformer like DistilBERT, which can generalize well even with limited labeled data.

2. How would you ensure your reply classifier doesn’t produce biased or unsafe outputs in production?
I’d audit the training data for biased or offensive language and apply filters during preprocessing. In production, I’d add confidence thresholds and fallback logic to avoid uncertain predictions, and monitor outputs regularly using human-in-the-loop review.

3. Suppose you want to generate personalized cold email openers using an LLM. What prompt design strategies would you use to keep outputs relevant and non-generic?
I’d include specific context like the recipient’s industry, pain point, and product value proposition in the prompt. I’d also use few-shot examples to guide tone and structure, and enforce constraints like length, personalization, and call-to-action clarity.
